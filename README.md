# tinyML-on-AVR
This project uses tinyML to estimate temperature values in a microcontroller-based application. It has the potential to improve efficiency, increase autonomy, and enhance safety in various industries. It showcases the potential of tinyML in future automation and low-power consumption-based intelligent machines.

This project involves incorporating machine learning into a microcontroller-based application to estimate temperature values. The microcontroller will acquire and process data from a sensor, and the ML model will use the data to estimate temperature values. The project will involve configuring the serial port on both the microcontroller and a PC to communicate and display data. Commands will be sent from the PC to the microcontroller over the serial port to display temperature values on a seven-segment display.

The ML model will be trained using the ScikitLearn library in Python to estimate temperature values based on voltage readings from the sensor data. The project will involve several key components, including data acquisition and display, pre-processing, min/max block, temperature calibration, serial port configuration, and ML model training.

The incorporation of tinyML in this project has the potential to make significant impacts in various industries. In wearable health monitors, tinyML can be used to monitor vital signs, such as heart rate and oxygen saturation levels, in real-time. In smart home devices, tinyML can be incorporated to detect and respond to changes in the environment, such as temperature and humidity. In industrial automation systems, tinyML can be used to monitor and optimize processes, reducing energy consumption and improving efficiency.

It is important to note that deploying tinyML in safety-critical applications requires rigorous testing and validation to meet safety standards. However, by incorporating tinyML into microcontroller-based applications, it is possible to improve efficiency, increase autonomy, and enhance safety in various applications. This project provides a basic implementation of ML into a microcontroller-based application, but it showcases the vast potential of tinyML in the future.
